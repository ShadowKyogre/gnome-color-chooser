Version 0.2.4

* changed project license to GNU GPL3+
* new (direct) runtime dependency: glib
* new compiletime dependencies: glib, gnome-common
* added following features:
  - disable menubar and toolbar shadows
  - change colors of hyperlinks used in (GTK+) applications
  - also affect fast-user-switch-applet by panel settings
* many "unimportant" changes like a decreased startup time by stripping down
  indirect dependencies by default and a decreased compile time
  (see ChangeLog for further details and problems that may occur using
   GNU binutils < 2.17 due to these changes)


Version 0.2.3

* updated debian/ directory to (hopefully) fulfill debian policy
* updated all language files (complete update is planned for 0.2.4)
* added following languages: bg, es, id, it, pt, tr, zh_CN
* made tooltip color changer compatible to GNOME 2.20 / GTK+ 2.12
* added option to set tooltip text color
* removed possibility of changing panel icon size (as i couldn't
  ever see a difference)
* added possibility to choose profiles
* added first profile "compact" (looks best with Arial 8 @ 96dpi),
  which is highly inspired by the theme "clearlooks-compact".
  Thank you very much, dear theme author!
* added GTK+ information window (help->information)
* added information window to GTK+ engines
* added manual page, see "man gnome-color-chooser" for more details

Version 0.2.1

* added French localization (a big thank you to zniavre!)

  creation of deb packages for debian based distros like ubuntu.

Version 0.2.0

* integrated my new Nautilus settings (requires nautilus_colorize patch or Nautilus 2.17+)
* added desktop icon colorization and desktop selection box settings
* added script for automatic installation on Debian systems
  (requires package checkinstall), theroretically it should even work
